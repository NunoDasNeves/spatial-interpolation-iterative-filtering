Aus weather uses variant of Barnes Interpolation and splines for rainfall

Deterministic Interpolation
- Global: Polynomial
- Local: Inverse Distance Weighting
- Local: Polynomial
- Local: Spline function

Geostatistical Interpolation (it's also deterministic I guess)
- (Ordinary, Simple, Universal, Disjunctive, Co-) Kriging
